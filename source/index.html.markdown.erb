### About Me

My name is Yijia Liu.
Now, I am a PhD candidate in [Research Center for Social Computing and Information Retrieval](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/).
One of my research interests is natural language processing, like Chinese word segmentation.
I am also interested in machine learning.
You can find the CV from [here](/cv).

I received my bachelor and master degree from School of Computer Science, Harbin Institute of Technology.
I used to be a sport programmer, and competed on behalf of [HIT ACM/ICPC Group](http://acm.hit.edu.cn/).
The best result I have achieved is silver medal in Asia Regional Contest.

In 2011, I worked as an intent developer in the NLP department of Baidu Inc.
In 2014, I spent a year working as a research assistant in Singapore University of Technology and Design, and it was a nice experience that I appreciate.

I have many hobbies, including [writing weblogs](/blog), [programming](https://github.com/Oneplus) and [painting](http://www.douban.com/photos/album/78794607/).
