#### PROJECT AND ACHIEVEMENTS

[Language Technology Platform (LTP)](http://www.ltp-cloud.com/), (2013 - Present)

* **LTP** is a software package that provides various Chinese natural language processing modules along with web service API.
* I am one of the developers and the major maintainer of LTP.
* I developed 4 modules including [Chinese word segmentation](https://github.com/HIT-SCIR/ltp/tree/master/src/segmentor), [part of speech tagging](https://github.com/HIT-SCIR/ltp/tree/master/src/postagger), [dependency parsing](https://github.com/HIT-SCIR/ltp/tree/master/src/parser) and [named entities recognizer](https://github.com/HIT-SCIR/ltp/tree/master/src/ner).
* I also developed the [API example for various languages](https://github.com/HIT-SCIR/ltp-cloud-api-tutorial) and contributed to the development of website.

[Zpar Project](http://www.sutd.edu.sg/cmsresource/faculty/yuezhang/zpar.html), (2013 - Present)

* developed transition based parser
* developed bug fixes

CLP 2012 Bakeoff Task 1: Chinese Word Segmentation on MicroBlog Corpora, (2012)

* I implemented a semi-supervised segmentation system, and it achieved an f1 score of 94.04% on the bakeoff test data.
