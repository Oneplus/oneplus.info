### PROJECT AND ACHIEVEMENTS

* [Language Technology Platform (LTP)](http://www.ltp-cloud.com/), (2013 - Present)

    LTP is a software package that provides various Chinese natural language processing modules along with web service API.
    On LTP 3.0
    * refactored 4 modules in LTP including Chinese word segmentation, part of speech tagging, dependency parsing and named entities.
    * developed the Python and Ruby API client.
    * contributed to the development of website.

* [Zpar Project](http://www.sutd.edu.sg/cmsresource/faculty/yuezhang/zpar.html), (2013 - Present)

    * developed transition based parser
    * developed bug fixes

* CLP 2012 Bakeoff Task 1: Chinese Word Segmentation on MicroBlog Corpora, (2012)

    I implemented a semi-supervised segmentation system, and it achieved an f1 score of 94.04% on the bakeoff test data.
